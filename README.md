# CPEN-311
Digital Systems Design: 

These are the labs throughout the course.

# Lab 1: Simple Datapath and Controller: Baccarat

The lab involved designing and testing a simple datapath and controller for a Baccarat game using Verilog. Key concepts included implementing a seven-segment LED driver, designing a state machine, and testing functionality using ModelSim and an FPGA.

# Lab 2: Circles and Triangles

The lab focused on interfacing a VGA adapter core to display graphics on a screen, implementing drawing algorithms in Verilog. Tasks included filling the screen with color patterns, using Bresenham's algorithm to draw circles, and rendering a Reuleaux triangle while testing the design in ModelSim and on an FPGA.

# Lab 3: Memories from Room 40

# Lab 4: Deep Neural Networks on FPGA

This lab focused on designing a deep neural network accelerator for an embedded Nios II system, integrating SDRAM, a PLL, and custom hardware accelerators. Key concepts included interfacing with off-chip memory, setting up Avalon memory-mapped components, and optimizing hardware for better performance while debugging a full system-on-chip.

Course Description: Advanced combinational and sequential electronic system design. Hardware specification, modeling, and simulation using hardware description languages (HDLs) and CAD tools. Design with programmable logic including FPGAâ€™s. Applications include complex state machines, microcontrollers, arithmetic circuits, and interface units.
